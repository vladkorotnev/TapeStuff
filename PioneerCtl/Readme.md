## Notes

Feel free to integrate this in your app. You need the [ORSSerialPort](https://github.com/armadsen/ORSSerialPort) classes for communication and the AKPioneerTapeRecorder class for easy control.
The transport control in the AIEdit.app is basically this whole window, copied into the other thing.
Don't forget to credit me for the component, that is much appreciated :3
